What: Built a web-based library app that allows users to add, view, and manage books.

Why: Designed to strengthen my understanding of object-oriented programming in JavaScript while practicing responsive UI and layout design principles.

How:

Implemented a Book constructor to encapsulate book data and methods.

Created a modal dialog form for users to input book details dynamically.

Used DOM manipulation to generate and update book cards in real time.

Added interactivity for toggling a book’s read status and removing books from both the display and the array data structure.

Stored all book objects in an in-memory array for dynamic rendering and management.
